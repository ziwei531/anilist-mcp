# AniList MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that interfaces with the AniList API, allowing LLM clients to access and interact with anime, manga, character, staff, and user data from AniList.

## Features

- Search for anime, manga, characters, staff, and studios
- Get detailed information about specific anime, manga, characters, and staff members
- Access user profiles and lists
- Support for advanced filtering options
- Retrieve genres and media tags
- **Dual transport support**: Both HTTP and STDIO transports
- **Cloud deployment ready**: Support Smithery and other platforms

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+

## Local Installation (STDIO Transport)

1. Add this server to your `mcp.json` / `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anilist": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "anilist-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ANILIST_TOKEN": "your_api_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You may remove the `env` object entirely, if you are not planning to use the AniList Token for operations that require login.

2. Restart your MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop)
3. Use the tools to interact with AniList

## Server Deployment (HTTP Transport)

### Self-Hosting
Follow the [Local Development](#local-development) instructions to set up the project locally, then run:
```bash
pnpm run start:http
```
This will start the server on port 8081 by default. You can change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

### Cloud Deployment

You can deploy this MCP server to any cloud platform that supports Node.js server applications.

You can also deploy via MCP platforms like [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@yuna0x0/anilist-mcp).

## Configuration
### Environment Variables (STDIO Transport and HTTP Transport server where host provides the config)

When using the STDIO transport or hosting the HTTP transport server, you can pass configuration via environment variables:
- `ANILIST_TOKEN`: (Optional) AniList API Token (Only needed for operations that require login)

> [!CAUTION]
> If you are hosting the HTTP transport server with token pre-configured, you should protect your endpoint and implement authentication before allowing users to access it. Otherwise, anyone can access your MCP server while using your AniList token.

### HTTP Headers (HTTP Transport where user provides the config)

When using the HTTP transport, user can pass configuration via HTTP headers:
- `Anilist-Token`: (Optional) AniList API Token (Only needed for operations that require login)

If the user provides the token in the header, while the server also has `ANILIST_TOKEN` set, the header value will take precedence.

### Get an AniList API Token (Optional)

To get an API token, follow these steps:

1. Go to [AniList settings](https://anilist.co/settings/developer).
2. Click on "Create New Client".
3. Use this URL as your client's "Redirect URL":
```
https://anilist.co/api/v2/oauth/pin
```

4. Click "Save"
5. Then go to https://anilist.co/api/v2/oauth/authorize?client_id={clientID}&response_type=token, replace the `{clientID}` with the client ID you get. It will ask you to log in and then provide you with the token to use.
6. Copy the generated token and use it in your `.env` file or environment variables.

Can you search for anime similar to "Bocchi the Rock!"?
```

Can you tell me about the character Hitori Gotou? Use the AniList tools to find information.
```

### Compare Studio Works

```
What anime has Studio Ghibli produced? Can you list their most popular works?
```

## Local Development

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as its package manager.

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuna0x0/anilist-mcp.git
cd anilist-mcp
pnpm install
```

### Configuration (Optional)

1. Create a `.env` file by copying the example:
```bash
cp env.example .env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file and add your AniList API token:
```
ANILIST_TOKEN=your_api_token
```

## Debugging with MCP Inspector

You can use the MCP Inspector to test and debug the AniList MCP server:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector -e ANILIST_TOKEN=your_api_token npx anilist-mcp

# Use this instead when Local Development
pnpm run inspector
```

Then open your browser to the provided URL (usually http://localhost:6274) to access the MCP Inspector interface. From there, you can:

1. Connect to your running AniList MCP server
2. Browse available tools
3. Run tools with custom parameters
4. View the responses

This is particularly useful for testing your setup before connecting it to MCP clients like Claude Desktop.
